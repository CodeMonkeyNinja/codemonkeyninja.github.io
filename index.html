<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>👋 Hi, I’m @HidekiAI (Hideki A. Ikeda), I&#39;ve &quot;profressionally&quot; been programming since April 1989.</p>
<p>My first professional job was mainly in Assembly lanaguage - 6502/65C816, Z80, Motorolla 68000, as well as C.</p>
<p>Other languages I can safely get by (because I&#39;ve coded professionally) are C++11, C#, and F#.</p>
<p>My professional experiences have been mainly been reflected by video game industries, but as hobbies and self educations, I do try to keep up with other intersts such as machine-learning and microservices.</p>
<p>🌱 I’m currently (and probably never stop) learning C++17 (for stability in libraries) and Rust (for functional aspect with C++ performance) for several years, and IMHO Rust is my all-time favorite.</p>
<p>👀 The projects you&#39;d find here: I’m interested in writing/working on projects that are somewhat useless (useful TO ME, but not too useful to you) but FUN TO ME... They are mainly in the languages I fancy at the moment, but at times the language chosen are mainly because of the supported libraries.</p>
<p>💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source libraries that are network-oriented, but am also interested in video game related libraries and projects.</p>
<p>📫 I guess you can reach me on LinkedIn username HidekiAI</p>
